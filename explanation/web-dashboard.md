The Anbox Cloud dashboard offers a web interface to create, manage and stream applications. The dashboard is especially helpful for developers new to Anbox Cloud and helps them by offering a simpler and intuitive management interface.

The dashboard comes pre-installed when you deploy the full version of Anbox Cloud (along with the streaming stack) or the Anbox Cloud appliance. It operates from behind a reverse proxy for performance and security reasons. The dashboard relies on OAuth for user authentication. The only OAuth provider supported right now is [Ubuntu One](https://login.ubuntu.com/).
