The guides in this section describe how to install Anbox Cloud.

It is important to remember that there is a difference between the full Anbox Cloud installation and the Anbox Cloud Appliance (see [Variants](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/anbox-cloud/17802#variants-1)). This section focuses on **Anbox Cloud**. For instructions on how to install the **Anbox Cloud Appliance**, see [How to install the Anbox Cloud Appliance](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/how-to-install-the-anbox-cloud-appliance/29702) or the [Install the Anbox Cloud Appliance on a dedicated machine](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/install-appliance/22681) tutorial.

Also, check the [Requirements](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installation-requirements/17734) before you start your installation.
