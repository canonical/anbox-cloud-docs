## Node controller charm
*Deprecated in 1.26.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.28.0*

## Juju 2.9
*Deprecated in 1.25.1* ; *Unsupported in 1.27.0*

Juju 2.9 is deprecated as of 1.25.1. Upgrade to Juju 3.6 instead. See [Juju upgrade documentation](https://canonical-juju.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/user/howto/manage-your-deployment/upgrade-your-deployment/) for detailed instructions.

For all new deployments, use the Juju snap from 3/stable or the latest/stable channel.

## Anbox Cloud Appliance `epoch=0` snap
*Deprecated in 1.22.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.25.0*

The Anbox Cloud Appliance is being reworked. We will provide the new Anbox Cloud Appliance implementation using [Snap epochs](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-epochs). 

The snap with `epoch=0` is the existing implementation that was deprecated in 1.22.0. Existing installations of the appliance will receive updates until Anbox Cloud 1.24.2.

Starting from 1.23.0, the snap with `epoch=1` will be the new implementation which is the default for new appliance installations. This implementation of the appliance will no longer use the Juju charmed operators internally but package all necessary service components directly within the snap. This helps to simplify the installation process and reduce overall footprint.

## Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)
*Deprecated in 1.22.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.24.0*

Support for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa) is deprecated in 1.22.0 and is planned to be removed in Anbox Cloud 1.24.0.

## EmuGL
*Deprecated in 1.22.0* ; *Unsupported in 1.23.0*

Support for the EmuGL renderer is deprecated in 1.22.0 and planned to be removed in Anbox Cloud 1.23.0. Starting with 1.22.0, VirGL will be the default renderer for NVIDIA GPUs with driver version 545 and later.
