### Synopsis

Generate a shell script to prepare a machine for the Anbox Cloud Appliance

The command generates a shell script which needs to be executed outside
of the snap execution environment to install additional dependency and
adjust system configuration.

Please carefully review the script before execution! It will install
additional kernel modules and GPU drivers and apply configuration
changes to tune these for Anbox Cloud.

You can show the script by running

  $ anbox-cloud-appliance prepare-node-script

  $ anbox-cloud-appliance prepare-node-script | sudo bash -ex

Once the script has finished all preparation is completed.
