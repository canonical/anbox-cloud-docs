The Anbox Cloud team has released a hotfix (1.19.0-fix1) to address the [Grafana security update](https://grafana.com/blog/2023/08/24/grafana-security-update-gpg-signing-key-rotation/).

The hotfix applies the updated `apt` key for Grafana. Monitoring with Grafana is enabled by default in the Anbox Cloud Appliance and hence without the hotfix, new installations of the Appliance may fail.
