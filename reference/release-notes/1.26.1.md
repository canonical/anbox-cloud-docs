## Bug fixes

The following bugs were fixed as part of the 1.26.1 release:

* [LP 2106113](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2106113) There were two commands in AMC that looked similar but had different purposes - `show-log` and `logs`. This was confusing about when to use these commands. The help text is now clarified to facilitate better understanding that `show-logs` is to obtain logs from an instance that is stopped or in an error state while `logs` is to obtain logs from a started or a running instance.<!--AC-3293-->
* [LP 2111893](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2111893) Stream can not be initiated due to intermittent TLS handshake failures.
* [LP 2100933](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2100933) AMS HTTP API documentation was missing information regarding the `/1.0/registry` endpoints.
* [LP 2097511](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2097511) The `minidumper` thread in the Anbox runtime is responsible for handling crashes in the Anbox runtime. When profiling, this thread was seen consuming excess CPU time even when a crash had not been detected yet.<!--AC-3330-->
* [LP 2106104](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2106104) The appliance initialization fails on a new machine that has an NVIDIA GPU but the driver is not yet installed. You see the following error when you try to initialize the appliance:<!--AC-3332-->

        Error: failed to parse NVIDIA driver version: strconv.ParseUint: parsing "": invalid syntax
* [LP 2111486](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2111486) The LXD charm was updated recently to avoid queries to the snap store to get the version information when the snap is already installed. Instead, the charm retrieves the necessary snap information using `snap list`.
However, the lookup sometimes fails and falls back to querying the snap store. This results in timeout exceptions from time to time, especially when a snap proxy is configured behind the store.<!--AC-3364-->
* [LP 2106114](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2106114) When you attempt to rotate the screen from portrait to landscape by setting `user_rotation` using `adb`, there is no error observed but the screen does not rotate for AOSP images. It works as expected for AAOS images, though.<!--AC-3370-->
* [LP 2106106](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2106106) Feature flags with a `.` in the name were not validated properly and displayed the following error:

        This field should be a comma separated list of words

* [LP 2111555](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2111555) If the database leadership within the LXD cluster changes during the interval between two `update-status` hook runs, the reported status could be outdated. 
This leads to temporarily incorrect status displays and could lead to decisions that may adversely impact your cluster. For example, if you decide a unit is not the database leader based on the status output and remove it, you could unintentionally be removing the actual database leader.
* [LP 2111597](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2111597) The *Settings* app crashes on Android 15 images when trying to access the *Accessibility* settings or the *Connected devices* section. This crash was caused because Anbox Cloud does not support Bluetooth.

**The following bugs were known issues in 1.26.0 and are fixed with this release:**

* [LP 2110194](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2110194) An instance could not be streamed after deploying Anbox Cloud using charms. You see the following error when trying to stream an instance using the dashboard:<!--AC-3335-->

    Anbox stream failed
    connector failed to connect: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'stun_servers')
This was a known issue from 1.25.0 till 1.26.0 release due to an invalid certificate used by the dashboard. Streaming did not work until the stream was edited, the invalid certificate removed, and the dashboard restarted.
* [LP 2110321](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2110321) There was a misleading error `program was killed: context canceled` after initializing the appliance. This error is misleading because you see it even when the initialization was successful and all services were active.<!--AC-3371-->
* [LP 2110323](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2110323) For the 1.26.0 release, the security patch level was not updated to the correct date even after the necessary security patches were applied for Android 15.

## Known issues

The following known issues exist in Anbox Cloud and are planned to be fixed in subsequent releases:

* [LP 2114950](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2114950) Even when the screen orientation is changed by the Android application, the device's [runtime configuration](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes) does not change. To work around this issue until a fix is available, [create an addon](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/howto/addons/create-addon/) with a pre-start [hook](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/reference/hooks/) containing the following script that clears the display settings causing the issue and use the addon in your application:

```
#!/bin/bash -ex

# Only run the hook for the base instance
if  [ "$INSTANCE_TYPE" = "regular" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

ANBOX_VERSION=$(cat /etc/anbox-release | grep version: | cut -d' ' -f2 | cut -d'-' -f1)
if [[ $ANBOX_VERSION == "1.26.1" ]] ; then
  init_numbat_rc_file="$ANBOX_DIR"/android-vendor/etc/init/hw/init.numbat.rc
  sed -i '/^\s*start numbat-settings\s*$/d' "$init_numbat_rc_file"
fi
```

* [LP 2113771](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2113771) This issue and workaround are applicable only when upgrading from 1.26.0 to 1.26.1. When upgrading charms from 1.26.0 to 1.26.1, the AMS node controller ends up in an error state. You don't have to worry about this as the AMS node controller is deprecated since 1.26.0 and the port forwarding is instead done by LXD.

We suggest the following workaround for this issue until it is fixed:

Check if the `exposed_instance_ports` configuration is set to a specific port or a port range for the LXD charm:

        $ juju config lxd exposed_instance_ports

If it is set, reset it:

        $ juju config lxd --reset exposed_instance_ports

Verify if it has defaulted to an empty value:

        $ juju status

Now open the required ports on the AMS node controller:

        $ juju exec -a ams-node-controller -- open-port 10000-11001/TCP

These ports will be opened only temporarily and will automatically be closed when the upgrade process is complete.

Upgrade the ams node controller charm to 1.26/stable channel:

        $ juju refresh ams-node-controller --channel=1.26/stable

The AMS node controller should now upgrade to 1.26.1 without an error.

Reapply the port configuration if a port range was specified for the LXD charm:

        $ juju config lxd exposed_instance_ports=<port_range>

* [LP 2112098](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2112098) While upgrading from 1.25.2 to 1.26.0, the dashboard displays the error `Ubuntu Pro token is not attached` even when the Ubuntu Pro token is already attached. This error is misleading and can be ignored. You can run `pro status` if you still wish to confirm.
* [LP 2111598](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2111598) For instances with NVIDIA GPUs, opening the *System* section of the *Settings* app in Android 15 with developer settings enabled, causes the app to crash.
* [LP 2112542](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2112542) Occasionally, when creating or deleting instances in a quick succession, an instance doesn't start. Instead, you see this error:

        Failed start validation for device "eth0": IP address "192.168.96.5" already defined on another NIC

Delete the instance(s) that ended up with an error status and create a new one.
