## Bug fixes

* [LP 2095559](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2095559) When stopping an instance with GPU slots and starting it later on, the instance fails to start. This issue was caused by multiple GPUs attached to the LXD container interfering with how the Anbox Cloud scripts detect the NVIDIA driver version.<!--AC-3097-->
* [LP 2095551](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2095551) When creating an application, the `hooks.timeout` property is auto-populated to have an empty value and this causes the operation to fail.<!--AC-3096-->
* [LP 2095179](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2095179) Unable to log in to the Anbox Cloud dashboard after updating the appliance's network address.<!--AC-3081-->
* [LP 2089261](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2089261) After restarting the host machine running Anbox Cloud, the instances that have a *running* status need to be restarted. This is due to an issue where the status of the instance in LXD is not in sync with the status in AMS.<!--AC-3077-->
* [LP 2093887](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2093887) Launching an instance from a `jammy:android12:amd64` VM image floods the journal logs with `Operation not permitted` errors.<!--AC-3067-->
* [LP 2092193](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2092193) Some Anbox system services take a longer time than usual to get started and show high CPU usage.<!--AC-3048-->
* [LP 2091921](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2091921) The dashboard generates an `anbox-connect` command on demand, but the connection URL that is displayed as part of the output is not enclosed within quotes, causing issues when copying and running the command in a `fish` shell.
* [LP 2094279](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2094279) Instance deletion does not happen in the background. When an instance is deleted and you are accessing a stream of a different instance, the streaming web page navigates back to the _Instance_ page to confirm the deletion of the other instance.
* [LP 2086853](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2086853) On all Android versions, irrespective of whether the instance is a container or a VM, taking pictures or videos from the default camera application results in only black and white pictures/videos with software rendering. This issue does not happen with a GPU.
* [LP 2095568](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2095568) The API swagger documentation states that `/1.0/applications/{id}/manifest GET` states that AMS returns `JSON` when AMS is actually returning an octet-stream.
* [LP 2096666](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2096666) When using the registration URL for the dashboard more than once, the following error occurs: `Error adding user to database`.
* [LP 2096982](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2096982) The name for the field that is used to set an expiration timestamp for a session share is inconsistent across the different API requests and responses.
To avoid confusion, the field naming should be consistent across all requests and responses.
* [LP 2071806](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2071806) Private bug <!--AC-2629-->
* [LP 2091609](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2091609) Private bug<!--AC-3046-->
* [LP 2096628](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2096628) Private bug<!--AC-3099-->
* [GitHub Issue 251](https://github.com/canonical/anbox-cloud-docs/issues/251) We have updated the prometheus metrics documentation to reflect accurate information.<!--AC-3056-->
