# 1.29.0

These release notes cover new features and changes in Anbox Cloud 1.29.0.

Anbox Cloud 1.29.0 is a minor release. To understand minor and patch releases, see [Release notes](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/release-notes/release-notes).

Please see [Component versions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/component-versions/) for a list of updated components.

## Requirements

See the [Requirements](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/requirements/) for details on general and deployment specific requirements to run Anbox Cloud.

## New features & improvements

### New instance copy feature

New instance copy support (via `amc copy <source> <target> [--node=<target>]`) in AMS allows for near-instantaneous cloning of existing instances. This dramatically reduces instance provision time and network load by leveraging ZFS copy-on-write, which is especially beneficial for large datasets (up to 600 GiB).

### Instance publishing support

Use the [amc publish command](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/howto/images/publish-instance-as-image) (via `amc publish <instance name> <image name>`) to create reusable images from running or stopped Anbox Cloud instances. This captures all file system modifications, enabling the creation of custom base images with pre-installed software and configurations.

### Runtime bitrate control for WebRTC

Users now have the ability to [dynamically adjust the minimum and maximum video bitrate](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/reference/api-reference/anbox-https-api/) for WebRTC streaming at runtime via the 1.0/platform HTTP API. This allows for application-specific optimization, leading to reduced network bandwidth usage and operational costs.

### Optimized disk quota

The AMS scheduler now uses a two-tier disk quota validation to prevent 'false exhaustion' and improve disk use, especially with ZFS storage drivers. This feature introduces a new **--no-disk-reserved** flag for allowing disk overcommitting (increasing node density) and enforces a mandatory 5% physical disk safety guard to ensure node stability.

### Charmed Etcd

Anbox Cloud now supports the new Charmed Etcd operator (starting in v1.29), which uses Juju secrets to securely store data and no longer exposes client private keys, significantly improving deployment security and robustness.

### Fine grained authorization

This release introduces [fine-grained authorization](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/howto/anbox/auth/) through integration with OpenFGA and a configured OIDC provider, enhancing access control for the Anbox Management Service (AMS) and Dashboard.

### Other

* The Android WebView has been updated to [142.0.7444.48](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/10/chrome-beta-for-android-update_22.html).
* The WebRTC version has been updated to 7499.

## Deprecations

### Legacy Charm deprecation

The legacy etcd charm will no longer be supported starting with Anbox Cloud 1.35.0. Existing users are encouraged to plan their migration to the modernized operator-based deployment.

## Removed functionality

(TBC)
There are no removed functionalities in this release.

* [LP 2119444](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2119444) When having some latency with the server, the dashboard may show a spurious error message that an instance with the name already exists. This error message is seen only for a split second, and appears even though no instance with the same name exists.
* [LP 2123900](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2123900) When `prepare-node-script` runs and `nvidia-smi` fails, the script does not indicate whether it succeeded unless we check the exit code.
