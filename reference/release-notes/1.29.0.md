# 1.29.0

These release notes cover new features and changes in Anbox Cloud 1.29.0.

Anbox Cloud 1.29.0 is a minor release. To understand minor and patch releases, see [Release notes](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/release-notes/release-notes).

Please see [Component versions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/component-versions/) for a list of updated components.

## Requirements

See the [Requirements](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/requirements/) for details on general and deployment specific requirements to run Anbox Cloud.

## New features & improvements

### New instance copy feature

New instance copy support (via `amc copy <source> <target> [--node=<target>]`) in AMS allows for near-instantaneous cloning of existing instances. This dramatically reduces instance provision time and network load by leveraging ZFS copy-on-write, which is especially beneficial for large datasets (up to 600 GiB).

### Instance publishing support

Use the [amc publish command](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/howto/images/publish-instance-as-image) (via `amc publish <instance name> <image name>`) to create reusable images from running or stopped Anbox Cloud instances. This captures all file system modifications, enabling the creation of custom base images with pre-installed software and configurations.

### Runtime bitrate control for WebRTC

Users now have the ability to [dynamically adjust the minimum and maximum video bitrate](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/reference/api-reference/anbox-https-api/) for WebRTC streaming at runtime via the 1.0/platform HTTP API. This allows for application-specific optimization, leading to reduced network bandwidth usage and operational costs.

### Optimized disk quota

The AMS scheduler now uses a two-tier disk quota validation to prevent 'false exhaustion' and improve disk use, especially with ZFS storage drivers. This feature introduces a [new **--no-disk-reserved** flag](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/howto/instance/create-instance) for allowing disk overcommitting (increasing node density) and enforces a mandatory 5% physical disk safety guard to ensure node stability.

### Charmed Etcd

Since the 1.29 release, Anbox Cloud deployment has migrated its dependencies from legacy charms to modernized ones. 
This includes:
* Support [charmed-etcd](https://charmhub.io/charmed-etcd) to replace the legacy etcd charm.
* Replaced easyrsa with the self-signed-certificates charm.
Also following this change, the base for Anbox Cloud deployment has been upgraded to Ubuntu 24.04.

### Fine grained authorization

This release introduces [fine-grained authorization](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/howto/anbox/auth/) through integration with OpenFGA and a configured OIDC provider, enhancing access control for the Anbox Management Service (AMS) and Dashboard.

### Other

* The Android WebView has been updated to [145.0.7632.26](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2026/01/chrome-for-android-update_01981585122.html).
* The WebRTC version has been updated to [7499](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+log/refs/branch-heads/7499).
* Starting with this release, Anbox Cloud continues to require NVIDIA driver series 570 for deployments using NVIDIA GPUs.
Although driver series 570 is end-of-life, newer driver series (including 580) are currently not yet supported and may not function correctly on some GPUs.

## Deprecations

### Legacy Charm deprecation

The legacy etcd charm will no longer be supported starting with Anbox Cloud 1.35.0. Existing users are encouraged to plan their migration to the modernized operator-based deployment.

## Removed functionality

There are no removed functionalities in this release.
