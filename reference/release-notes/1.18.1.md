## Bug fixes

- [AC-1558](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1558) Fix the crash caused by the `boot-application-relaunced` watchdog when streaming the `Beach Buggy Racing` application in the portrait mode.
- [AC-1560](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1560) Require a user confirmation when executing `amc start <container_id>` for containers with an `error` state. This fix is added so that users are aware that starting a container from an `error` state drops the container logs.
- [AC-1570](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1570) Add an intuitive error message in certain cases that directs users to check the snap access. Prior to 1.18.1, Creating an application from a directory gives a vague error message (e.g `no such file or directory: /my-app`) which might not reflect the real reason for failure. For example, when the directory exists but the AMC snap cannot access the directory. 
- [AC-1600](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1600) Fix the permission denial error when broadcasting `ACTION_CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS` intent from AOSP calendar app.
- [AC-1606](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1606) Fix the image ID out-of-sync issue when adding an image into AMS. This fix enables people to launch a raw container with an image ID returned from the `amc image add` command.
- [AC-1608](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1608) Fix the `InputReader: Received unexpected event` error when enabling the touch emulation by default. This fix avoids unexpected events sent from the client to the Android container resulting in multiple error logs showing up during Android runtime.
- [AC-1611](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1611) Fix the issue in web dashboard when the **Session ID** was truncated in the session view.
- [AC-1612](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1612) Fix the issue in Anbox Cloud web dashboard when occasionally the navigation bar of the Android system may not appear.
- [AC-1624](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1624) Fix the broken graphical output during the game play of `Bingo Blitz`.
- [AC-1625](https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/AC-1625) Fix the broken graphical output during the game play of `Slotomania`.
